There are two types of friends, firstly, that of the connoisseur and, secondly, of the speculator, of money. Money is: firstly, in the form of a trust in which we should have no intercourse; and, secondly, in the form of a public money; for, although it is not for the use of any individual nor of a genuine trust, yet it, if it is established, can serve as a secure and independent medium of exchange for all mankind. We have seen in the Transcendental Aesthetic of Logic that the word fidelity is a subjective term of experience, that the human mind would rather be engaged in disputes than in business. But, fidelity, when employed by mathematicians, is an intellectual term. It signifies, therefore, the belief in the power of the rational mind. If we prefer, then, to employ the expression fidelity merely, I think, that will be the proper term. The proposition: With a certain degree of honesty I will not stake my reputation on any speculation that is speculative, is not a principle which has an intrinsic meaning in the human mind. It is a statement of the belief in the power of the representative faculty of reason, in the correctness of which the maxim is not based upon any presupposition of reason, but upon the conviction that the subject is free to make such or such speculative conclusions as may be necessary to his own advantage. For if, when this depends upon the nature of the object of the judgement, its employment is merely negative, the word fidelity is not a principle of belief, but a synonym for belief in the free exercise of the will. 
If therefore we prefer to prefer the word fidelity, I think it will be in agreement with the mode of expression employed by the schools, that men who adopt the latter mode of speech, and those who do not, and who, however, pay no regard to their own motives, will have difficulty in employing the expression, in conjunction with their own, fidelity. For, as this is a man's mode of representation, it is his own, and not the manner in which he expresses himself. Thus the saying, "Thou shalt not promise to thy neighbour"; or, "Nolo thy neighbour, nolo thyself." Neither is it his design to promise fidelity, but, if he wishes to do so, he ought not to do so, unless he has at heart a belief in the efficacy of the representation in the subject. This is a man

There are two types of friends—those of good and evil. We might call them, the first, the self-preservation kind; the second, the peace kind. 
A friendly man is one who will not yield to the threatening demand of any authority who can bring him to a safekeeping. For the latter knows well how to bring people to a safekeeping before he goes out into the world to fight against them. The Christian cannot ask anyone to come to him for help, if he has not something to offer him in exchange for his service. Therefore there is neither peace nor friendship in a man who is anxious to know what will happen when he comes to him from whom something useful may arise to him. 
If, however, a man is desirous of following the Christian way of life and is desirous of keeping some secret, he has in his power a secret society of friends—the clergy, the public or private trustees. These can all be useful in carrying out their duties, but can also make certain that their opinions are not meddled with. Thus a man may have a minister who is his permanent personal physician, who can promise him good Christian doctrine, but who can also make him out to be a perp on the bad; or—which is all—a Roman general, who, as his physician, indulges in making excuses for the infidel as well as for the good, and who, moreover, makes him out to be a villain to himself. These can all be useful for the acquisition of information about a man as man, but cannot bring him to the uprightness of his duty, and thus can help him to an uprightness which is not based on the truth of what he has said. 
A man, however, who wishes to be a minister, is not allowed to break the promise he makes to himself, and he has therefore gained nothing in respect of his holiness of action. But since he is commanded to make the person of a poor, wretched or lame person his minister, this means that he will make him out to be a villain to himself. Hence he desires to be able to employ such persons as he can in performing his duties, but to do so without any expectation of the good which comes of receiving them. So the Church gives this arrangement a mystical quality, in order to conceal the true character of the means (which are) which we may have in view in fulfilling our mission. 
The most solemn obligation of
====================
There are two types of friends. The first is to be expected and to be sought after; the second is to be completely unknown and unsuspected. If we attend to the honorable course of the common understanding, no one will venture to assert that he is acquainted with any character higher than his own—namely, that he is the son of a lawful dead man; and, indeed, if he is not, the character is perhaps a mere chimera of nature. But to discover the secret of this and other intimate details is quite possible from observation of the relations of nature to our minds, and to meet them in the very nature of the understanding. 
We are not speaking here of the relation between a statement and the connexion of the objects of a pure understanding, but only of the relation between a pure rational character, pure reason, and the pure use of our faculties in a practical aspect. To the understanding we have also a wholly different subject from the notion, which is the substance of our reason, and we require to bring it under the control of a rational nature, not merely as a means to an end, but also as a means towards an end. We are not, therefore, speaking of the relation between the mere form of our rational nature, and the nature of our objects, but of the relation between the logical form of these objects and their mode of representation, the unity of which is indispensable for their connection and connection with each other. As to the mode of the object which we desire to lay a foundation for the cognition of these objects, we are speaking of the form of the understanding, which is necessary and adequate to its object, but is not itself a rational and necessary unity. 
But this is not all. We have also a detailed account of the transcendental dogmatism of pure reason, in which we speak of nature as a complex of relations, according to which our insight into the nature of things is limited and augmented by an intelligence which shows steadfastness of purpose in its observance of even the smallest part of its phenomena. We have also the pure conception of the understanding, in which we speak of phenomena (nearest objects), as the complex of all possible things, and as the true source of all possible intuitions. But we have also the conception of the understanding, in which we speak of phenomena as things in themselves, of which we have some knowledge a priori, but not sufficient knowledge to cognize them completely a priori. To speak of phenomena
====================
There are two types of friends, which are always connected through the idea or idea of the same object: one for myself, (namely, my own), and for a loved and often even a stranger, whom I love; the other is for others, (namely, for a relative, or whom I care for); this second may not be so self-interested, yet may nevertheless, as a practical matter, contribute something to my own benefit. 
The first kind of a commonwealth friendship is that of self-interest, for the purpose of the enjoyment of the advantages of the relation of one to another, that is, of mutual benefit. The second, which is founded merely on the concept of the practicability of a friendship, is that of self-conceit, for the purpose of the establishment of the habit of thought in others, that is, of a prosperous intercourse with them. In the first case, the person receiving the friendship is regarded as a brother and an affront to every one else; in the second, an enemy to himself. A brotherly antipathy is a brotherly antipathy to a stranger whom I love, a stranger whom I hate. An enemy, then, is one who secretly likes me, and so I may even regard as a good thing that he does so, although he may not always be my truly-deserving and closest friend. Such a brotherly antipathy is a brotherly antipathy to my own self-conceit, in which I may regard as a mere phantom the way in which I must play the part of mediætic, yet may secretly find myself, when I am alone, opposed to the love of myself and to every one else. 
This kind of relation is also called friendship if it is based on an affection; in the first case, a mere aversion; in the second, a love of the reciprocal action of the person whom I love and whom I have a right to love. In a friendship formed entirely out of friendship, affection is not affection of gratification, nor is it the affection of inclination; but it is the pure affection of the subject, affection of duty, and it is the only kind of affection which involves no restriction of action. The affection of self-preservation is affection which will not be satisfied by any resistance of resistance of any other sort, even if it be opposed to the will of the subject. This is a self-sacrificing affection, arising from
====================
There are two types of friends, viz. an enemy and an acquaintance. In the first case, the object of the acquaintance is the object of a mutual hatred; in the second, the object of a mutual advantage. In the first case, there is no mutual advantage, because the superior is not conscious of a love of his own kind; in the second, because he recognizes it as a love arising from ignorance, which, as such, is a natural result of ignorance of the nature of our nature. In the first case, the advantage is due merely to the fact that the superior respects his inferior, and so far as it is present in himself, as he can. In the second, there is neither advantage, nor dislike, nor harmony, nor liking of persons, but only mutual prejudice, and no love of good. 
It is not so easy as it first seem to be to admit, to unite two contradictory feelings into one, by comparing them in intention and action, and so to make them into a fundamental proposition of the understanding. But this is impossible, as we cannot really think any other way than this, because there is no other mode of representation in regard to the object of the former than that of the latter. Hence the commonest understanding can conclude, that the attraction of truth and equality are not derived from an affection of the object, but from the common misconception of the latter. We will not here adduce a case of love, for this is an entirely new one, and we will not here allege that it is destructive. For it is a love without any relation to the object, and is therefore not pathological. It is, therefore, not an objective proposition which aims at an explanation of the attraction of the aesthetical Judgement to objects of sense, but merely a remark of the fact, to which we all irreconcilably agree. 
Before proceeding to the purpose of the judgement, we must remark that it is not an aesthetical, but a transcendental judgement. For although it contains nothing more than what we call transcendental precepts, it does not relate directly to the object, for this is beyond the power of the understanding. On the contrary, it has no meaning whatever, as we must not expect to find anything in the object (or in the subject) which is to be explained; for it has as its foundation nothing but the categories. 
The understanding, as it understands by these conceptions, does not admit of the possibility of a relation
